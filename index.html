            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Mathume Mahubane, a Bachelor of Oral Health Sciences student at Wits University and a proud Promaths Alumnus. My academic journey has been shaped by a deep passion for dentistry and public health, with a particular interest in prosthodontics, oral pathology, and orthodontics. I am committed to understanding the complexities of oral health and how they connect to broader issues of community wellbeing. This commitment drives me to approach my studies not only as a clinical pursuit but also as a way to make a meaningful impact on people’s lives.</p>
            <p>Over the course of my studies, I have developed strong skills in academic writing, case reporting, and literature reviews. I enjoy synthesizing complex information into clear, accessible formats, whether for academic assignments or community education projects. My ability to communicate effectively through structured writing and visual tools such as tables, charts, and flow diagrams has allowed me to present oral health concepts in ways that are both professional and easy to understand. These skills have proven invaluable in bridging the gap between clinical knowledge and practical application.</p>
            <p>Beyond the classroom, I am motivated by the role of oral health in public health policy and community outreach. I believe that oral health is a cornerstone of overall wellbeing, and I am passionate about contributing to initiatives that improve access to dental care, particularly in underserved communities. I see oral health education as a powerful tool for empowerment, enabling individuals to take charge of their own hygiene and preventive care. This perspective has inspired me to explore digital platforms and interactive resources as a way to extend the reach of oral health education.</p> <p>Looking ahead, my goal is to combine clinical expertise with public health initiatives to create sustainable solutions for oral health challenges. I envision myself designing responsive, user-centered websites and digital portfolios that serve both professional and community purposes. By integrating my technical skills in web design with my academic background in oral health sciences, I aim to build platforms that not only showcase professional work but also provide accessible education to the public. Ultimately, I hope to contribute to a future where oral health is recognized as an essential part of overall health and where communities are equipped with the knowledge and resources they need to thrive.</p>
